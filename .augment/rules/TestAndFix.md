Run all tests in the GitHound project and fix any issues that are encountered during test execution. Please follow these steps:

1. First, identify the testing framework and test structure used in the project by examining the codebase
2. Run the complete test suite using the appropriate test command for the project
3. Analyze any test failures, errors, or warnings that occur
4. For each issue found:
   - Investigate the root cause of the failure
   - Implement the necessary code changes to fix the issue
   - Ensure the fix doesn't break other functionality
   - Re-run the affected tests to verify the fix works
5. Continue this process until all tests pass successfully
6. Provide a summary of what issues were found and how they were resolved

If you encounter any ambiguities about which tests to run or how to run them, please ask for clarification before proceeding.
